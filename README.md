# docker-swarm-diff
See what's different between what swarm thinks is going on, and what's really going on

# Notice!
The default docker version currently supported is Docker 1.12.6, until we resolve some of 1.13.x & 17.03-ce's networking issues. 
If you need docker-swarm-diff in a newer version of docker, checkout the docker1.13 branch.
